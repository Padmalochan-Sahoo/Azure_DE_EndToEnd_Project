      ########## Implementation Guide ############

Overview :-
This implementation guide describes the end-to-end data processing pipeline from capturing real-time data using Azure IoT Hub to storing and processing it in Azure Synapse Analytics.

Architecture :-

Azure IoT Hub: Capture real-time data from IoT devices.

Azure Stream Analytics: Process and transform data in real-time using Stream Analytics. Configure an output to send data to Azure Event Hub.

Azure Event Hub: Receive processed data from Stream Analytics. Configure an Azure Function to be triggered when new data is available.

Azure Function: Use an Azure Function to write data from Event Hub to Azure Cosmos DB.

Azure Data Factory (ADF) Pipeline: Create an ADF pipeline to copy data from Cosmos DB to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).

Azure Synapse Analytics: Process data using Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse). Use Spark for data processing and write the processed data to Azure SQL Database.

Implementation Steps :-

1. Azure IoT Hub
Set up an IoT Hub to ingest data from IoT devices.
Configure IoT devices to send telemetry data to the IoT Hub.

2. Azure Stream Analytics
Create a Stream Analytics job.
Define input as IoT Hub and output as Event Hub.
Define transformations and filters as needed.

3. Azure Event Hub
Set up an Event Hub to receive data from Stream Analytics.
Configure Azure Function to be triggered when new data arrives.

4. Azure Function
Write an Azure Function to process data from Event Hub.
Use Azure Cosmos DB SDK to write data to Cosmos DB.

5. Azure Data Factory (ADF) Pipeline
Create an ADF pipeline to copy data from Cosmos DB to ADLS Gen2.
Define source and sink datasets and configure data movement activities.

6. Azure Synapse Analytics
Create a Synapse workspace.
Use Synapse Spark to process data. Write Spark jobs to transform and analyze data.
Store the processed data in Azure SQL Database for further analysis.

         ###### Deployment Steps #######

Deploy IoT Hub and configure devices.
Set up Stream Analytics and define the job to process data.
Configure Event Hub to receive processed data.

Configure and deploy Synapse Analytics for Spark processing.

        ###### Dependencies #######

Azure subscription and necessary permissions.
Access to IoT devices and their configurations.
Knowledge of Stream Analytics SQL-like queries.
Understanding of Cosmos DB and Event Hub configurations.
